#I first import the final merged file. 

#I then aggregate the Total_Score column for the years from 2003 to 2020. I save the file in three formats--RDS, CSV and parquet. 

#The second aggregation I created a new column where I divded the years into 2003-2011 and 2012-2020. I then group the data by the new column (Year_Range) and country. I sum the Polyachy and Total_Score columns and arrange the data by country. 
#I also decided to subtract the result of the country data in the two ranges--2020-2012 subtracted by 2003-2011. 
# I then merged the data sets into new dataset and saved it as RDS, CSV, and parquet. 

#3 I grouped by country and Year Range, two inputs, and different functions (Mean and Median). I saved the files as RDS, CSV, and parquet. 

#Additional 1--I grouped the data by Year and found the mean, max, min and median for most of the major columns. I saved it by the three types of data (RDS, CSV, and parquet). 

#Additional 2--I grouped the data by Country and found the mean, max, min and median for each country in the dataset. I saved it by RDS, CSV, and parquet.
